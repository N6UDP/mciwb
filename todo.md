mciwb
-----

-   add Volume (and Blocks?) to the Copier class and expose to Iwb
-   add switches and levers
-   save and load of selected blocks
-   tutorial on creating signs
-   add a consistent way to discover and delete signs, switches, monitors

village
-------
 
-   towers and walls
-   a drawbridge / portcullis that open and close
-   a rotating object using blocks (with a face on)
-   or even better a patrolling tower / robot ? 

Finale
------

Have a button that destroys the village and flattens the land

and a button that re-creates everything from scratch.
