Modules and Packages
====================

In this tutorial we will start to use vscode to develop a Python package 
for making buildings in the game. We will be starting with 
the pagoda building from the previous tutorial and here we will also 
go into the detail of how the pagoda function works.

Preparing VSCode
----------------

VSCode has some great extensions for working with Python files. Let's make sure 
those are installed now. 

Click on the extensions Icon and type ``pylance``. Click on ``install`` for 
the two Microsoft extensions listed.

Getting a Bash Prompt
---------------------

We are going to use some bash (zsh) commands here so lets open a second terminal
in VSCode so that we can have a bash prompt but also keep our Python shell
prompt open.

Right click in the VSCode terminal area and select ``Split Terminal``

You can grab the dividing line between the two terminals and drag it to the
right with your mouse. This makes the Python terminal bigger and the 
Bash terminal smaller. Then your terminal area of VSCode should look like 
this:
