# mciwb

Minecraft interactive world builder

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/gilesknap/mciwb>
:---:           | :---:
PyPI            | `pip install mciwb`
Documentation   | <https://gilesknap.github.io/mciwb>
Releases        | <https://github.com/gilesknap/mciwb/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from mciwb import __version__

print(f"Hello mciwb {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m mciwb --version
```
