Minecraft Interactive World Builder
===================================

.. warning::
    
    UNDER DEVELOPMENT: not all features are yet available and the tutorials 
    are not yet complete.
    
This project is intended as a fun way to learn the Python Programming Language.
It has the following features:

 - Use Python to create anything inside of Minecraft worlds. 
 - Call Python code when events occur inside the world.
 - Use an iPython prompt to interact with the world by typing Python commands
 - Have your player inside the world execute Python code by placing command 
   signs or activating switches/levers with Python actions.

All instructions on how to set up a Minecraft Server and the Python developer
environment are included. There will be a step by step tutorial to
introduce Python Programming.


See 
`Introduction <https://gilesknap.github.io/mciwb/main/tutorials/00-prereq.html>`_ 
to begin.
